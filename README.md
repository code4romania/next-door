The app is a community platform with two components - web app and native mobile app. The main purpose of this project is to grow neighbor communities and increase interaction and support between people living within the same zipcode in both calm and difficult times. In emergency situations, like the pandemic we are facing or in the event of a major calamity like an earthquake, the closest people who can help are your neighbors. But other than very noisy social networks we do not really know who lives around us and who could help or might need help in difficult situations.

The app allows users to
- join a hood
- see their neighbours
- discuss with neighbours in groups or direct messages
- receive updates from public authorities
- receive updates from public and private utilities providers
- post help offers and help requests
- view directories of useful contacts and information

In a second release of the app we aim to allow users to also add their local businesses in the app, create events and start joint activities.
